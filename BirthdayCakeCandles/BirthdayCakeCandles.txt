This code works by first reading the number of candles and their heights, which are stored in a list or array. It then finds the tallest candle height, either by using a loop to compare each value or by applying a built-in function like Max(). After identifying the tallest height, the program counts how many candles have that same maximum value. Finally, it prints the count, which represents the number of candles that can be blown out.

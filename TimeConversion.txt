The problem converts a 12-hour format time string (with “AM” or “PM”) into a 24-hour format. The code first extracts the hour, minute, and second parts from the string. If the time is AM and the hour is 12, it changes the hour to 00. If the time is PM and the hour is not 12, it adds 12 to the hour. The minutes and seconds remain unchanged. Finally, the program combines the adjusted hour, minutes, and seconds into the 24-hour format and prints it.
